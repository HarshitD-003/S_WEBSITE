              As the Sankalp Club of Lnmiit, we celebrate Janmashtami to mark the birthday of Lord Krishna. We take several initiatives to make the occasion memorable and joyous.
              
              One of the main activities we undertake is decorating the college with vibrant rangolis, colourful lights, and fragrant flowers to create a festive atmosphere. We also encourage everyone to dress up in traditional attire and participate in cultural programs such as singing bhajans and performing skits.
              
              We conduct a 'dahi handi' competition, where teams compete to break a pot filled with curd that is suspended at a considerable height. This event brings out the competitive spirit and teamwork among the participants.
              
              Additionally, we organize a 'rasleela' performance, depicting the life of Lord Krishna, to showcase the cultural significance of the occasion. We also distribute prasad, sweets, and food to the underprivileged, promoting the values of charity and kindness.
              
              Overall, Janmashtami celebrations are an opportunity for us to come together, celebrate, and imbibe the teachings of Lord Krishna in our lives.

        <p class="card-text-ev">As part of our village project, we visit the nearby village of Rupa Ki Nangal to teach children every Saturday and Sunday. This project aims to provide education and improve the overall quality of life for the children in the village.

          We teach a range of subjects such as mathematics, science, and language, along with life skills such as hygiene, nutrition, and communication. Our team of volunteers works closely with the children to identify their learning needs and provide individual attention to those who need it.
          
          Apart from academics, we also conduct various extracurricular activities like games, art, and music to encourage holistic development. We believe in creating a friendly and nurturing environment for the children to foster their curiosity and creativity.
          
          This project has helped us build strong ties with the local community, and we have witnessed a positive impact on the children's academic performance and social skills.

MWEP (Mess Workers Education Program) is an initiative aimed at providing education and skill development opportunities to mess workers in educational institutions. This program is designed to empower mess workers, who are an integral part of the campus community but often marginalized and overlooked.

Through MWEP, we conduct regular training sessions to improve the mess workers' culinary skills, hygiene practices, and food safety measures. We also offer basic literacy and numeracy classes to enable them to read and write and perform basic calculations.

Moreover, we organize various health and wellness activities, such as yoga and meditation sessions, to improve the mess workers' physical and mental well-being. Our goal is to create a supportive environment for the mess workers, where they can learn and grow professionally and personally.

MWEP has been successful in improving the mess workers' quality of life and helping them gain recognition and respect for their work. We are committed to continuing our efforts to promote education and empowerment among mess workers and other marginalized communities</p>

  Every 15th of August, our club organizes a heartfelt event that extends gratitude and recognition to the unsung heroes of our campus - the mess workers. The "Make a Meal" initiative is a testament to our commitment to fostering a sense of community and appreciation for those who work tirelessly behind the scenes.

  On this special day, our members actively participate in the preparation of meals alongside the mess workers. This collaborative effort not only provides us with an opportunity to learn more about their daily tasks but also underscores the value of their work. As we work side by side, we share stories and build connections that transcend roles and positions.
  
  The culmination of the event is a heartfelt meal service. With dedication and smiles, we serve the food we've collectively prepared to the mess workers. This gesture of service aims to provide them with a moment of respite from their regular routine and to show our genuine appreciation for their hard work.
  
  To add a touch of celebration, we decorate the mess area in vibrant colors, creating an atmosphere of festivity. As the meal concludes, we present them with sweets and gifts as tokens of our esteem. These small yet meaningful gestures symbolize our gratitude for their daily contributions.

            <p>Sankalp is a social and spiritual club at LNMIIT that believes in giving back to society. We are a family of like-minded individuals who share a passion for helping the less fortunate. Our club hosts a range of events that aim to bring a positive change to the world around us.

              One of our most popular events is the village project. We visit the nearby village and teach the children new skills and help them with their studies.
              
              Another important event is the MWEP, which stands for Medical and Wellness Program. Through this program, we work towards improving the health and well-being of the people in our community. We conduct regular medical camps and awareness programs to promote healthy living.
              
              We also organize several pujas throughout the year, such as Saraswati Puja. Our members come together to decorate the campus and make the event a grand success.
              
              Our cultural fest is another event that we look forward to every year. We invite children from nearby villages to join us for a day of fun and festivities. We provide them with sweets and other treats, and we all have a great time together.
              
              Finally, we also visit slums in the nearby areas to provide food and other necessities to the people living there. We believe that small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.
              
              Overall, Sankalp is more than just a club. It is a community of individuals who are committed to making the world a better place.</p>
